# appc.sqlite3
An SQLite3 connector for Arrow

## 1. Installation
Just enter the following command in your arrow project root to install the SQLite3 connector. 
```sh 
appc install connector/appc.sqlite3
```
The command downloads and installs the connector to the node_modules/connector folder, updates the appc.json file, and generates a connector configuration file in the project's conf directory.

## 2. Configuration

Set the configuration object in your ``conf/default.js`` file:

```javascript
connectors: {
    'appc.sqlite3': {
	    db: '<database filename>',
	    path: '/path to the db file/',
        dbConfiguration: {
            ...
        },
	    modelAutogen: true,
	    generateModelsFromSchema: true
    }
}
```

* **filename** (required): Valid values are filenames, ":memory:" for an anonymous in-memory database and an empty string for an anonymous disk-based database. Anonymous databases are not persisted and when closing the database handle, their contents are lost.
* **dbConfiguration** (optional): You can set a db configuration object. Valid options are:
    * **trace**: provide a function callback as a value. Invoked when an database query executes with a rendering of the statement text.
    * **profile**: provide a function callback. Invoked every time a database query executes.
    * **busyTimeout**: provide an integer as a value.

This will automatically generate models based on your database schema. To create a new model, you will have to insert a table for it in the database and it will be generated for you.

## 3. Usage
Take a look at all available options and query parameters in the API documentation section of your arrow administration.
Options are available under the group **appc.sqlite3**.

### Example Model Usage
For example, to extend the user model, set it such as:

```javascript
var User = Arrow.Model.extend('user', {
    fields: {
        name: { type: String },
        email: { type: String },
        role: { type: String },
        username: { type: String }
    },
    connector: 'appc.sqlite3'
});
```

### Query operators currently supported:
#### Syntax: {"$lt": {"field": value} }
Example:   {"$eq":{"username":"John"},{"age":20}}

* $eq - matches entries with value of a field equal to the specified value
* $lt - matches entries with value of the field less than (i.e. <) the specified value
* $lte - matches entries with value of the field less than or equal to (i.e. <=) the specified value
* $gt - matches entries with value of the field greater than (i.e. >) the specified value
* $gte - matches entries with value of the field greater than or equal to (i.e. >=) the specified value
* $ne - matches entries with value of the field not equal (i.e. !=) to the specified value 

**Note** that the Model.Count method requires a WHERE parameter. If you want to get the count of all entries in a table, use the FindAll method and get the length of the result set.
